# BattleBit Remastered Technical Glossary

This glossary provides detailed definitions and explanations for technical terms commonly used in the BattleBit Remastered Server Setup Guide.

## Python 3.12.0

Python is an advanced, high-level programming language known for its straightforward syntax and readability. The specific version required for BattleBit Remastered server setup is 3.12.0. Python can be downloaded from the official website at [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

## SteamCMD

SteamCMD is a command-line utility provided by Valve's Steam service. It is used to manage, install, and update game servers and other Steam-related content. In this context, SteamCMD is crucial for the initial setup and regular maintenance of the BattleBit Remastered game server.

## Configuration Files

### `setup_config.ini`

This file is a key configuration file located in the root directory of your server setup. It contains essential setup configurations and parameters necessary for the initial setup of the server. Users should modify this file to tailor the server setup to their specific requirements.

### `config.ini`

Located in the `Server` directory, the `config.ini` file holds important server-specific settings, including the server name, port number, and path to the server executable. This file should be edited after the setup script has been run to ensure that it aligns with the desired specifications of your server.

## Command Prompt or Terminal

The command prompt (Windows) or terminal (Unix-based systems like Linux and macOS) is a text-based interface for interacting with the operating system of a computer. In the BattleBit Remastered server setup guide, it is primarily used for executing various commands and scripts necessary for server configuration and management.

## Whitelisted

In the context of online gaming servers, being whitelisted means that the server restricts access, allowing only specific, pre-approved users or entities to connect. For BattleBit Remastered, this means that the server will only be able to establish a connection to the master server if it has been explicitly whitelisted by the game's developers.

## Master Server

The Master Server plays a pivotal role in online gaming infrastructure. It acts as a central hub that maintains a list of all available game servers, along with their respective information. Game clients rely on this server to discover and connect to game servers. For BattleBit Remastered, a server must be whitelisted by the game's developers to connect with the Master Server.

## Server Executable

This refers to the main software application that runs the BattleBit Remastered game server. The server executable's path and various configuration settings are defined in the `config.ini` file.

## Log File

A log file is a digital record that captures a chronological list of events, actions, or errors generated by a software application or computer system. In the context of the BattleBit Remastered server, a log file is generated to document server activities and any errors that might occur during its operation.

## Ctrl+C

Ctrl+C is a widely used keyboard shortcut, primarily employed to send an interrupt signal to a running program in a command prompt or terminal. In the BattleBit Remastered server setup, pressing Ctrl+C in the terminal is the recommended method to safely and gracefully terminate the game server.

## Support Discord

For additional assistance, community support, and troubleshooting, users can visit the [Support Discord](https://discord.gg/5HVygFQJaja). This Discord server is dedicated to providing help and support for setting up and managing the BattleBit Remastered game server.
