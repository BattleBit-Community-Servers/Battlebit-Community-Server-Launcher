## Configuration Files

### `setup_config.ini`

### `config.ini`

The `config.ini` file is another configuration file located in the `Server` directory. It holds server-specific settings such as server name, port, and executable path. This file should be configured after running the setup script to match the server's specifications.

## Command Prompt or Terminal

A command prompt (on Windows) or terminal (on Unix-based systems like Linux and macOS) is a text-based interface for interacting with a computer's operating system. In this guide, it is used to run commands and scripts necessary for server setup and management.

## Whitelisted

Being whitelisted means that the server allows only specific users or entities to connect. In this context, the BattleBit Remastered server will only connect to the master server if the server's IP or identity has been whitelisted by the game's developers.

## Master Server

The Master Server is a central server that manages the list of available game servers and their information. Game clients use the Master Server to discover and connect to game servers. In the context of BattleBit Remastered, the server will only connect to the Master Server if it has been whitelisted by the game's developers.

## Server Executable

The server executable is the main program that runs the BattleBit Remastered game server. Its path and configuration are specified in the `config.ini` file.

## Log File

A log file is a record of events, actions, or errors generated by a program or system. In this guide, a log file is created to capture server-related events and any errors that occur during server execution.

## Ctrl+C

Ctrl+C is a keyboard shortcut used to send an interrupt signal to a running program in a command prompt or terminal. In the context of this guide, pressing Ctrl+C in the terminal will gracefully shut down the BattleBit Remastered game server.
